 ME_Sicily_Events.1.T: "Civitas Invitissima"
 ME_Sicily_Events.1.D: "The city of Drepanum has a long story of being the shield of the Island against foreign armies, The important strategic position was used during the First Punic War when the Carthaginians defeated the Roman fleet in the Battle of Trapani in 249 BC. Thus the Romans conquered the city, latinizing its name in Drepanum. \nAfter the Romans, the Vandals, then the Byzantines dominated the city, but it was in the 9th century AD. with the Arabs (who called it Itràbinis, Taràbanis, Tràpanesch) and with the Normans (who conquered it in 1077 led by Roger I) that the city reached a fervent development, thriving in trade and cultural activities, so the port had great turmoil also thanks to the crusades. The port of Trapani, during the Middle Ages, was one of the most important in the Mediterranean: all the most powerful seaside cities (Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Amalfi) had a consulate in the Trapani port and, especially with the first two, Trapani had the agreement to act as a stopover for their possessions in North Africa. \nIn 1266 the Venetian and Genoese fleets collided in front of the port of Trapani during the San Saba war. The Venetians captured the entire Genoese fleet. \nAfter a short period under the Angevins, Trapani actively participated in the uprising of the Sicilian Vespers led by Palmiero Abate, passing to the Aragonese in 1282. During the 14th and 15th centuries the city grew and became the most economically and politically important center of western Sicily. In 1443, from simple Earth it became Civitas. Ferdinand the Catholic granted the city the title of Invittissima in this regard of the glorious resistance always made to the enemies of the kingdom."
 ME_Sicily_Events.1.OPT1: "We should reinforce our defenses"
 ME_Sicily_Events.1.OPT2: "A better port should fit our needs"
 ME_Sicily_Events.1.OPT3: "Our saline are too precious to be left aside"

 ME_Sicily_Events.2.T: "Sicilian Renaissance"
 ME_Sicily_Events.2.D: "The gigantic figure in the cultural landscape of the early Renaissance in Sicily is Antonello da Messina who with his complex formation between Naples, Venice and Flanders demonstrates the circulation of ideas that characterized the era. His works for the commissions of the island and his definitive return home represented the first affirmation of Renaissance painting on the island, thanks to a crowded laboratory that introduced the new taste for the human figure, the pictorial genre of the portrait into traditional production. and a new role of the artist are no longer just an anonymous craftsman. \nAmong the most interesting artists active in Messina Giorgio da Milano, Andrea Mancino, Bernardino Nobile and the Carrarese Giovan Battista Mazzolo, owner of an important workshop, which was joined by Messina Antonio Freri (also active in Catania), without count the presence of Antonello Gagini, son of Domenico, in Messina. As in Palermo, these Tuscan and Lombard artists brought in the city and its surroundings to Calabria, the rich repertoire of classicist architectural decorations. However, throughout the fifteenth century, despite some obsolete interpretations, the architecture continued to follow the late Gothic tradition despite the presence of Renaissance decorative episodes. \nThe renewal of language therefore did not immediately involve the entire building organization. The main Sicilian architect of the fifteenth century was in fact Matteo Carnilivari who used a personal language with Gothic and Catalan elements, as in the church of Santa Maria della Catena in Palermo. His prestige as a builder was one of the obstacles to the affirmation of the Renaissance language, outside the decorative repertoire of marble workers. In addition to the few traces left by Laurana, at the end of the fifteenth century, the Renaissance language can be found only in minor episodes such as the Ventimiglia chapel in the church of San Francesco in Castelbuono."
 ME_Sicily_Events.2.OPT1: "An architect will build our prestigious palaces"
 ME_Sicily_Events.2.OPT2: "We need a painter to frame our glory"

 ME_Sicily_Events.3.T: "Knights of Malta"
 ME_Sicily_Events.3.D: "In 1314 the order of the Knights Templar was dissolved and most of its properties were conferred on the Knights Hospitallers who, however, maintained sovereignty in Rhodes. The Templar possessions were organized into eight \"Languages\" (Auvergne, Aragon, Castile, France, Germany, England, Italy and Provence). Once in Rhodes, and now known as the Knights of Rhodes, they were forced to develop above all the military side of their business, engaging above all against the Berber corsairs. During the 15th century, the Hospitallers victoriously opposed two invasion attempts: one in 1440 by the Mamluk sultan of Egypt, the second in 1480 by the Ottoman sultan Muhammad II, who, after the fall of Constantinople saw one of his main enemies in the Knights of the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem. \nEscaping and trying to rebuilding a crusading fortress in the east they asked for the island of Malta to be their new starting ground."

 ME_Sicily_Events.4.T: "Kingdom of Africa"
 ME_Sicily_Events.4.D: "The government of Norman Africa was modelled carefully on the precedents offered by the pre-Norman emirs. As in Sicily, close attention was paid to the interests of the Muslim population, while the Christians benefit from the exemption from the poll-tax... Apart from the garrisons in the African towns, and apart from the use of Norman-style cavalry charges, evidence for the presence of 'Norman' or 'Frankish' characteristics cannot be found. The architects of the African empire were not 'Normans' but Greek and Arabic courtiers... \nControl of Africa gave us control of all the sea routes between the western and eastern Mediterranean."
 ME_Sicily_Events.4.OPT1: "We will rule with an iron fist"
