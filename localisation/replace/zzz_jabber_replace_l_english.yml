 tercio_reform_desc:0 "The Lords Astarii have more than proved their mettle, and much of Great Andalos' military success can be laid solely at their feet. Despite their origins, they have come to be famously and staunchly loyal to their Andal lords. They are, however, still men - and men can be flexible when circumstances are right. Let us persuade some of these warriors to fight under our banners, so that we may share in the glory of their prowess."

 tercios_reform_desc:0 "Before the fall of Byzantium, it was not uncommon for disgraced nobles to find new purpose in the Crusades; as a result, there was hardly ever a shortage of noble households crossing the Aegean eastwards. Some opted to stop in Greece, either to simply rest and resupply; or to accrue some glory and gold by making good on deals struck with local lords. One such campaign led a Crusader army, battered and weak, to request aid and shelter within the walls of Athens, then our seat of power. They were lead by Raymond de Lusignan, who had fought with the then-Duke of Hellas on prior wars against common enemies in Anatolia and beyond. Recognizing his old brother-in-arms, the Duke welcomed the crusaders.\n\nHaving fled the political fires of Aquitania, Raymond made Hellas his new home, and his crusaders followed suit. Emboldened by his new liege, he began to shape his troops into a peculiar order: initially mere retainers and palace guards, the 'Astari' - as they were henceforth named - grew in importance and favor as the Dukes grew ever wearier of their feudal subjects' reliability, culminating in their establishment as the Dukes' personal, permanent military; the first of its kind.\n\nEver since then, the Astari Order has grown tenfold, incorporating both wayward crusaders and youthful greeks, never suffering in its legendary prowess and loyalty for it: they have defended the House of Sintra a thousand times and now, as a part and parcel of the Archon's armies, will do so for Andalos entire."

Ever since the Sintras' flight to Hispania, the order has become a cornerstone of any Andal army and has accrued a number of impressive victories over the centuries. Their widespread renown and unique disregard for one's status has made them both the ambition of many young lads throughout the realm amd the dread of many foreign lords in Europe and beyond."
