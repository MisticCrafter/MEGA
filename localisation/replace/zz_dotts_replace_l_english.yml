In times of weak [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s or high demands of Palatini, the influence of this class increases significantly within [Root.GetUsableName].

 janissaries_estate_events.1.a:0 "Ok."
 janissaries_estate_events.2.t:0 "Decline of the Palatini"
 janissaries_estate_events.2.desc:0 "Although a well-disciplined military force, the Palatini are not immune to infightings in their own rows. Several chains of events led to rivalries between the different commanders of the Palatini regiments, resulting in a less coherent organization of the Palatini.

 janissaries_estate_events.4.t:0 "Palatini Land Ownership"
 janissaries_estate_events.4.desc:0 "The Palatini differ from other military forces as they receive a consistent salary. Although usually in form of Ducats, it is not unusual for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to give away own territory to the Palatini as form of payment. A number of commanders have found interest in gaining territory of their own in [janissary_province.GetName].

This is especially true if the subjects are the elite guardians of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]. For the last years, the Palatini expressed a remarkable satisfaction with the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] over the [Root.GovernmentName].

Failing to grant more rights and privileges, our state disappointed the expectations of the Palatini for years. The neglect of Palatini soldiers has created an atmosphere of resentment and distrust that now threatens to erupt into violent conflict. As such it was no surprise when the commanders of the Palatini made an ultimatum to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]: we either give in and give concessions to the Palatini, or have to face open rebellion."

His tactical genius as well as his administrative skills have shown a promise of greatness.\nNaturally, it did not take much time until even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] noticed his talent. The young man arrived at [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s court today, and waits anxiously for what the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has to say."

 janissaries_estate_events.11.desc:0 "Ever since the Palatini gained the privilege to have a profession outside the military, the ranks of the scholars and administrators within our state have grown. Men of science embrace the many literatures our [Root.GovernmentName] has produced over the centuries and as such see little interest in returning to their soldier life. While advantageous for our administration, this antipathy towards their actual intended job will certainly decrease the quality of our Palatini troops if we allow this to continue."
