 eth_eliminate_the_semien_rebels_desc: "For centuries, the Crown has been troubled by pests. Mad crusaders here, treacherous Nubians there, opportunistic nobles elsewhere - all of them came pecking at our feet, snatching swaths of land in our darkest moments. Enough is enough." 
 eth_find_other_christians_title: "Contact with Andalos"
 eth_find_other_christians_desc: "Due to the fervor and zeal of Christian Europe, our kingdom - which had for centuries remained isolated and separated from the heart of Christianity - restablished ancient connections with the likes of Italia, Achaia and Anatolia. Initially, we were ecstatic at seeing our christian brethren once again, but this would not last. Perceiving our rites as 'heretical', they seized the opportunity and pounced upon our shores, snatching Zeila, Aussa and Maida. We have since recovered, but the wound has not yet healed.\n\nIn recent years, queer merchants have turned up on our ports, claiming to be as Christian as we are, though not a crusader by any means, finding the mere notion of that disturbing - they claim to hail from 'Andalos', a kingdom in faraway Iberia, and say that their king - archon? - is quite interested in accessing our spice-rich trade routes. The premise of a Christian ally opposed to the crusader vermin is a tempting one, but we must not rush ourselves into ruin once again."

Despite their origins, they have come to be famously and staunchly loyal to their Andal lords. They are, however, still men - and men can be flexible when circumstances are right. Let us persuade some of these warriors to fight under our banners, so that we may share in the glory of their prowess."

Each was led by a Grandmaster, numbering seven in total, who was in turn elected by senior members of the army every five years."

 TERCIO_DESC: "Before the fall of Byzantium, it was not uncommon for disgraced nobles to find new purpose in the Crusades; as a result, there was hardly ever a shortage of noble households crossing the Aegean eastwards. Some opted to stop in Greece, either to simply rest and resupply; or to accrue some glory and gold by making good on deals struck with local lords. One such campaign led a Crusader army, battered and weak, to request aid and shelter within the walls of Athens, then our seat of power. They were lead by Raymond de Lusignan, who had fought with the then-Duke of Hellas on prior wars against common enemies in Anatolia and beyond. Recognizing his old brother-in-arms, the Duke welcomed the crusaders.\n\nHaving fled the political fires of Aquitania, Raymond made Hellas his new home, and his crusaders followed suit. Emboldened by his new liege, he began to shape his troops into a peculiar order: initially mere retainers and palace guards, the 'Astari' - as they were henceforth named - grew in importance and favor as the Dukes grew ever wearier of their feudal subjects' reliability, culminating in their establishment as the Dukes' personal, permanent military; the first of its kind.\n\nEver since then, the Astari Order has grown tenfold, incorporating both wayward crusaders and youthful greeks, never suffering in its legendary prowess and loyalty for it: they have defended the House of Sintra a thousand times and now, as a part and parcel of the Archon's armies, will do so for Andalos entire."

 orangists_rally_against_rival: "Paradyxists Unite Nobles Against Rival"
 desc_orangists_rally_against_rival: "The Prince of Frisia has taken up leadership in the war against our hated rivals, rallying the nobles behind this noble cause."
 dutch_republic.6.da: "Although still maintaining a hold on the position of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the rule over [Root.GetName], the influence of the Paradyxists has fallen slightly in recent times. Nobles who sought power by aligning themselves with the family are increasingly coming to view this as a sign that the House of Paradyx, despite its legacy, is still at the mercy of the bureaucracy and political environment of the republic.\n\nSome of those who have formed the backbone of our armed forces are requesting that [Root.Monarch.GetName] commits to asserting power more clearly in military matters. None of their suggestions contribute to very constructive purposes, but may impress the old guard."
 dutch_republic.8.da: "The Paradyxists already wield great influence over the [Root.GetAdjective] rule, and the latest developments in the political arena have only served to strengthen their grip on our supposed republic. Some of our previously loyal subjects have taken this as a sign that the priorities of [Root.GetName] have shifted and that a time is coming when tax money will be wasted on vain pursuits of noble families. Down this road, they claim, lie only petty wars and tyranny. In protest, many people are refusing to pay taxes to support this government."
 dutch_republic.9.da: "The reign of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is all but absolute. The Princes of Frisia have secured power over [Root.GetName] for a long time ahead. Everything points to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] ruling for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entire life.\n\n$SPYMASTER$, one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] closest advisors, agrees with this assessment. This is a person fiercely loyal to their country, so loyal, in fact, that they would personally take the life of anyone who threatens the republic. In a recent meeting with a few carefully selected people, $SPYMASTER$ let it be known that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self and the Paradyxists' stranglehold on the rulership is perhaps the biggest threat of all. $SPYMASTER$ can assure that the lifetime rule will be a short one."

In a recent meeting with a few carefully selected people, $SPYMASTER$ let it be known that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self and the Paradyxists' stranglehold on the rulership is perhaps the biggest threat of all. $SPYMASTER$ can assure that the lifetime rule will be a short one."
 dutch_republic.11.d: "There is peace between us and the Dutch Republic... for now. The final terms of the truce were largely agreed upon when the war ended, but some room for negotiation still remains. We know that the current rulers are interested in weakening the position of the Paradyxists, a faction within the republic seeking to grant power to a house of nobles.\n\nIf we were to put forward a suggestion for an Act to keep the next Prince of Frisia away from political power, it could serve both to improve our diplomacy with the current administration and ensure that there won't be a king on their throne to lead them into another war against us."
 dutch_republic.14.da: "The Statist rulers have succeeded in making institutions of [Root.GetName] increasingly representative, but one institution that has resisted recent changes is the army. One of our generals belongs to a family of nobles who have strong ties to the House of Paradyx and has been sabotaging our efforts to oust the Paradyx loyalists from high-ranking military positions.\n\nNow, he's gone even further and wants one of his relatives, also an Paradyxist, to act as advisor to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. While this young person seems like a talented commandant, we would loathe giving them influence."
 dutch_republic.17.da: "The recent increase in support for the Paradyxist faction has sparked a discussion about how our republic is viewed by other nations. A country with a weak monarch may be regarded as easy prey and unworthy of respect. What does this mean for a country lacking a monarch altogether?\n\nThe Paradyxists claim to have the answer. For our nation to be a contender on the international arena, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must show [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to unite and rule. Vain power displays are normally considered a waste, but perhaps one would be necessary now."
 dutch_republic.18.da: "The victory of the opposition in the latest struggles between Statist and Paradyxist interests has turned out to unexpectedly benefit [Root.GetName]. Nobles who had taken modest interest in military matters before are now hoping for a future where a Prince of Frisia can lead our people to glory. They see a bright and proud future for the [Root.GetAdjective] republic, and whether or not they are right, this will benefit our military with much-needed leadership."
 dutch_republic.19.da: "Republican rule is frequently about compromise, finding a middle ground so a decision can be made. Sometimes, it isn't. In the last conflict between Paradyxist and Statist interests, when the administration came out victorious, some nobles saw this as a sign that the republican rulers have grown unreasonable and presumptuous.\n\nMorale among the soldiers in our nation may remain high, but some generals are losing faith in the [Root.GetAdjective] cause. Wrong as they might be, our military strength will suffer from their lacking leadership."
 dutch_republic.20.da: "[Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] is a person of action. That is why [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] was employed by the administration and how [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] has continued to hold the position as [Root.GetName]'s chief military advisor despite being a well-known supporter of the Paradyxist cause. Now, [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHis] actions have turned against us.\n\nClaiming that the unquestioned strength of the Statists is ruining [Root.GetName], [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] has rallied others who find their power threatened by the ruling faction behind [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHim] and is attempting to stage a coup and take power. Now it is up to us to take action or to let this happen."
 dutch_republic.23.t: "Paradyxists Rally Nobles To War"
 dutch_republic.23.da: "We are at war, but not just any war. Our enemy is not only one of current circumstance, but a hated rival of [Root.GetName]. At times such as this, the provinces are united against a common threat, and nobles are eager to lead them into battle. Who better to lead than the Prince of Frisia?\n\nWhile allowing the Paradyx family to rally other nobles and the common people to war would strengthen combat morale, the Statists are not fools. They know that the effects of this unity will linger beyond the war and that Paradyxists will be reluctant to let go of any power they are granted, even for the best of causes."
 dutch_republic.24.da: "The war is over, greatly aided by the efforts of the Paradyxists, who are still enjoying popular support from these actions and retaining much of the power granted to them. Statists who were willing to make concessions to the family during wartime are now demanding a return to how things were before the war. Anything less, they argue, would be tantamount to giving control over the country to whoever leads it into battle, throwing away the representative institutions the republic is so proud of."
