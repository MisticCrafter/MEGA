  flavor_mistic_swiss.10.d: "Ever since the beginning of the 'Sovvertimento' - the so-called 'purification' of Italian society, as carried out by the demons in charge of Lombardy -, the once-great cities of Northern Italy have fallen into absolute disarray. Homes burned, families were torn apart and people were killed or taken God knows where. Italy bled, and those lucky enough to escape those Lombard claws washed up on our shores, downtrodden and poor.\n\nWe bent, gave them but a handful of acorns and they grew an entire forest in return.\n\nLife has not been kind to the peoples of Italy, but their spirits remain unbroken. From whatever they carried on their hands and backs, they have forged multiple enterprises and industries, breathing new life into our cities and boosting their wealth and affluence significantly. Northern Italy was once considered the heart of Europe, undoubtedly due to the character of their peoples: they have now made our lands their own, and we are all the richer for it."

  flavor_mistic_swiss.13.d: "A new world has been discovered beyond the waves of the Great Atlantic, and there's hardly a soul left in Europe that does not know of it. Noble palaces and lowly taverns alike are abuzz with endless talks of it, of its queer new peoples, of its unearthed treasures and the dozens upon dozens of ships that depart from westward ports, headed towards it.\n\nThis spark shines twice as bright in the homes of the disgraced. Those whose rulers made crucial mistakes, or whose realms fell into the all-devouring grasp of empires.

  flavor_mistic_swiss.17.t: "The New World"
  flavor_mistic_swiss.17.d: "The meteoric advance of Christendom through the Arab world has brought much more than mere faraway lands under the banner of the faithful: an absolute wealth of ancient knowledge, of Greek and Roman classical works long preserved by Muslim scholars, was retrieved and subsequently diffused throughout all of Europe. These works, namely those that focus on mathematics, astronomy, engineering, navigation and healing, have reignited the fire of learning long since smothered into embers in the many scholarly circles of Europe, and there are now endless debates on each and every detail of the nature of the world raging across the continent's academies.\n\nOne such debate is of particular interest to the westernmost crowns: that of the shape of the world; that it is round like a ball and not flat as a piece of parchment, as was the established worldview. It appears that the proposal is sound. The logic is rigorous and without flaw. The arithmetic is spotless. And so, the western heresies grin in delight.\n\nFor years, the Catholic crowns have tightened their grip on trade, imposing cruel embargoes and blockades on those who do not follow their rites - terra clausa, they call it. Gold and silver barely trickle in, not to speak of spices, silks, and the other hundreds of fabrics and other goods that once poured in from the East. The notion of an alternative path to this wealth is tantalizing, and many monarchs have begun offering satchel after satchel brimming with gold to experienced navigators, hoping they one day return to tell the right tale..."
