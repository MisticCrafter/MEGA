 CK3_NAME:3 "Crusader Universalis"
 CK3_DESC:3 "The maps of Europe have changed since the 11th century. An ambitious player, perhaps a gift from God, perhaps a spawn of the Devil, drove the business of Europe towards one goal. But can this ambitious player control the unfolding of an entire planet for four more centuries without losing their supernatural qualities?"
 CK3A_NAME:3 "Once Upon A Time"
 CK3A_DESC:3 "The world remained unchanged during lengthy centuries. Even the most rebellious warmongers remained quiet and nobody tried to murder his neighbor. Yet this time of stagnation, a gift of a Devil for sure, has to end. Today, the 11th of November, in the year of our Lord 1444, the Renaissance began, a new movement that will destroy the eternal status quo."

 string_start_babenberg:0 "The §YBabenburgs§! nearly lost their homeland of §YAustria§! during the Lausitz period. Now, they are the leaders of the §YGerman Confederation§!. The §YGerman Confederation§! was formed after the rise of §YTrinacria§!, A revival of Rome completely destroyed the idea of the §YHoly Roman Empire§!. Instead it reformed and centred its identity on its cultural centre; §YGermany§!. \n\nIt has been laughed off by the breakaways of the §YConfederation§! as an old dying idea to save a broken institution, and the continuation of a decentralized empire squabbling and infighting suits their interests better than a unified §YGerman Kingdom§!. However the §YBabenbergs§! using the influence of those breakaways have completely taken over the reigns of power in the §YGerman Confederation§!, how will they steer it into the future? Will they continue down the path of decentralization or will they try to federalize and subsume power into the §YBundespraesident's§! office?\n\nThe Babenbergs have claimed the thrones of §YBohemia§!, §YAustria§! and §YFrance§!, and soon are called upon by German Translyvania to claim the throne of §YHungary§!. The influence of the mother of Charlie the II of §YAustria§! proclaimed the §YPragmatic Sanction§! which made Females able to be elected as §YBundespraesident§!. Women in the §YGerman Confederation§! are protected by the §YBundespraesident§!. All of this and more leaves §YAustria§! in an incredibly privleged situation enabling the Queens and Kings alike ruling from Wien the ability to get away with basically anything as far as the §YGerman Confederation§! is concerned in the East.\n\nIn The West of the §YGerman Confederation§! we have our holding of the Kingdom of §YFrance§!, bordering it to the South is the Princedom of §YSwitzerland§!. §YSwitzerland§! was a breakaway state of the §YGerman Confederation§!, but on the other hand it also helped keep the Babenbergs in charge of the §YGerman Confederation§!. Relations between our two states deterioated during Charlie I's reign. We shall see if they turn hostile towards the §YConfederation§! in the decades to come.\n\nOn our western border we have the §YZeven Provinces§! of the §YNetherlands§!. They currently hold a neutral stance towards up despite holding land rightfully belonging to the §YConfederation§!, the §YRhineland§!. We shall see if they continue their policies of expansionism and if further action is needed against them.\n\nIn our South we have §YCroatia§!, which wrongfully treated our dynasty in the past. Contemporary thinkers petition us to wipe them off the face of Europe and integrate them into the §YConfederation!§!\n\nTo our North East we have §YPoland§!, who we won against to gain our independence and titles in §YBavaria§!. The Kingdom of §YPoland§! has long been hailed as a golden prize to have. We must consider this carefully.\n\nTo our East we have the Kingdom of §YHungary§!, which constituences of have petitioned us to take the throne of §YHungary§! off its current King. However, in the far East of our border there is a rising state like a phenoix from the ashes of former §YRoman Eastern territories§!; §YThe Ruthenian Tsardom§!. They could potentially be massive allies in taking down §YPoland§! and securing our eastern borders from raiders and barbarians!"
