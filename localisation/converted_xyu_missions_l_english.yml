 ck_eu_baltic_missions_1_task_2_desc: "Circumstances have forced us to resort to blade once again. The hardships we now endure may propel our state into something mightier. We are no strangers to war, after all."
 ck_eu_baltic_missions_1_task_3_title: "Power in the Baltic"
 ck_eu_baltic_missions_1_task_3_desc: "Ever since the times of the Romans, us Balts were considered inferior peoples, even less noteworthy than barbarians. Time for us to make a stand and demonstrate the errors in such judgement."

 ck_eu_europagan_missions_1_task_2_title: "Raider Fleet"
 ck_eu_europagan_missions_1_task_2_desc: "In many cases, a good bounty can be discovered within the merciless winds and thundering waves. Why bother invading an enemy, when we can take their riches in the Sea?"

 ck_eu_europagan_missions_1_task_3_desc: "Regardless of what wealth we bring home, a good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must also oversee growth of his own lands. Perhaps, with proper management, we can make [Root.GetName] a rich and self-sufficient country?"
 ck_eu_europagan_missions_1_task_4_title: "Religious Pragmatism"
 ck_eu_europagan_missions_1_task_4_desc: "The strength of [Root.Religion.GetName] lies in flexibility. The amount of Gods our people worship probably reaches hundreds, if not thousands.

 ck_eu_norse_missions_1_task_4_desc: "Germans, Slavs and even petty Balts continue their fruitless efforts at strengthening their position as major merchants in the Baltic Sea. Sadly for them, there is an already established overlord of this trade region - [Root.GetName]!"
 ck_eu_norse_missions_1_task_5_title: "Unrivaled Naval Industry"

 ck_eu_euromuslim_missions_1_task_4_desc: "For nearly an entirety of Middle Ages noble city of Rome was in a disgusting state of decay with ancient monuments being dismembered brick by brick.

 ck_eu_euromuslim_missions_1_task_5_desc: "Many brave and learned adventurers and scholars have traveled distant lands, capturing the culture and life of incredibly diverse peoples.

 ck_eu_jewish_missions_1_task_3_title: "High Priesthood"
