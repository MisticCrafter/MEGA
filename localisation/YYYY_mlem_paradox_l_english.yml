Duchess Astolfo III, whom would be Stadhouder Astolfo II, is the late ruler's pick. She would instill a ton of stability to the realm rather quickly, being the designated heir, but she is known as ruthless and efficient in her management of Flanders. Some have called her tyrannical, but those people mysteriously have disappeared. She also has demonstrated skills as a stateswoman, and her enemies in the parliament have also disappeared.\nHer enthronement as the stadhouder would result in the crown gaining her land in Flanders under direct control, should we risk tyranny for stability?"

The skull is suprisingly in well condition for a person who died over one hundred years ago; which almost gives her some merit in thinking it is alive.

Domestic merchant guilds have championed the policy as a way to combat foreign influence in our economy and to strengthen our personalized trade policy. Opponents have stated that these policies would cause an overall decrease in economic activity as foreign merchants would avoid paying the tariff by avoiding our markets.\n\nThe second policy is a removal of consumption taxes on goods, as well as tariffs, and a decrease in state regulation of the markets. Proponents of this policies have championed a novel theory called 'free-market economics' a new field of civil study that details the failures of mercantilist policies and regulation within the open trade of goods. They support the bill viewing it as a way to allow the people to choose who to support with their ducats. Opponents of the bill have stated the removal of anti-usury laws as well as the weakening of taxation policy will result in a decrease in economic prowess within our borders.\n\nThe bill has reached the parliament floor, and it is up to the parliamentarians to choose which side to support."
