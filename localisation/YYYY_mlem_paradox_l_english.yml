Duchess Astolfo III, whom would be Stadhouder Astolfo II, is the late ruler's pick. She would instill a ton of stability to the realm rather quickly, being the designated heir, but she is known as ruthless and efficient in her management of Flanders. Some have called her tyrannical, but those people mysteriously have disappeared. She also has demonstrated skills as a stateswoman, and her enemies in the parliament have also disappeared.\nHer enthronement as the stadhouder would result in the crown gaining her land in Flanders under direct control, should we risk tyranny for stability?"
