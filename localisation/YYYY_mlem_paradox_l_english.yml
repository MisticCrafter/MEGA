The skull is suprisingly in well condition for a person who died over one hundred years ago; which almost gives her some merit in thinking it is alive.

Domestic merchant guilds have championed the policy as a way to combat foreign influence in our economy and to strengthen our personalized trade policy. Opponents have stated that these policies would cause an overall decrease in economic activity as foreign merchants would avoid paying the tariff by avoiding our markets.\n\nThe second policy is a removal of consumption taxes on goods, as well as tariffs, and a decrease in state regulation of the markets. Proponents of this policies have championed a novel theory called 'free-market economics' a new field of civil study that details the failures of mercantilist policies and regulation within the open trade of goods. They support the bill viewing it as a way to allow the people to choose who to support with their ducats. Opponents of the bill have stated the removal of anti-usury laws as well as the weakening of taxation policy will result in a decrease in economic prowess within our borders.\n\nThe bill has reached the parliament floor, and it is up to the parliamentarians to choose which side to support."

Nobles who sought power by aligning themselves with the family are increasingly coming to view this as a sign that the House of van Paradyx, despite its legacy, is still at the mercy of the bureaucracy and political environment of the republic.\n\nSome of those who have formed the backbone of our armed forces are requesting that [Root.Monarch.GetName] commits to asserting power more clearly in military matters. None of their suggestions contribute to very constructive purposes, but may impress the old guard."
 dutch_republic.8.da:0 "The Paradyxists already wield great influence over the [Root.GetAdjective] rule, and the latest developments in the political arena have only served to strengthen their grip on our supposed republic. Some of our previously loyal subjects have taken this as a sign that the priorities of [Root.GetName] have shifted and that a time is coming when tax money will be wasted on vain pursuits of noble families.

The final terms of the truce were largely agreed upon when the war ended, but some room for negotiation still remains. We know that the current rulers are interested in weakening the position of the Paradyxists, a faction within the republic seeking to grant power to a house of nobles.\n\nIf we were to put forward a suggestion for an Act to keep the next Prince of van Paradyx away from political power, it could serve both to improve our diplomacy with the current administration and ensure that there won't be a king on their throne to lead them into another war against us."
 dutch_republic.14.da:0 "The Statist rulers have succeeded in making institutions of [Root.GetName] increasingly representative, but one institution that has resisted recent changes is the army. One of our generals belongs to a family of nobles who have strong ties to the House of van Paradyx and has been sabotaging our efforts to oust the van Paradyx loyalists from high-ranking military positions.\n\nNow, he's gone even further and wants one of his relatives, also an Paradyxist, to act as advisor to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. While this young person seems like a talented commandant, we would loathe giving them influence."

A country with a weak monarch may be regarded as easy prey and unworthy of respect. What does this mean for a country lacking a monarch altogether?\n\nThe Paradyxist claim to have the answer. For our nation to be a contender on the international arena, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must show [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to unite and rule. Vain power displays are normally considered a waste, but perhaps one would be necessary now."
