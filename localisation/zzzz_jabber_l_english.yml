 # Gov. Reforms
 andal_crown_reform:0 "Andal Crown"
 andal_crown_reform_desc:0 "Nearly four centuries ago, Auria Cintranos, known thereafter as 'the Dreamer', foresaw a most terrible fate for her people and her house, then only Dukes of Hellas. Few believed her in the Azure Court, yet it took very little time for the young oracle to be proven right. So we acted. We fled first to Sardinia, then to islamic 'Isbiliya' and founded here a realm mightier than Auria could've ever foreseen."
 andal_subject_reform:0 "Andal Viceroyalty"
 andal_subject_reform_desc:0 "The fate of Hispania has been resolved. The Andals, a people born of an unlikely marriage between the Hellenes of the East and the Mozarabs of the South, have donned an iron wreath and claimed all of Hispania as their rightful domain. We are lords and dukes in our own right, aye, but it is Andal law, Andal tradition and Andal decrees that permeate and govern our realm, for good and for bad."
 absolutist_andalos_reform:0 "Grand Archonate"
 absolutist_andalos_reform_desc:0 ""
 mauretanian_crusader_reform:0 "Crusader Kingdom"
 mauretanian_crusader_reform_desc:0 "Born of the bloody Sicilian Crusades, the newly-established Crusader states of Mauretania have stood far longer than most wagered they would. Most though that the Frankish and Italian nobility would be embroiled in endless clashes with their new Berber subjects, but history took the opposite course: the martial high nobility of Western Christendom quickly brought the exceptionally skilled Numidian cavalrymen into the fold, forming an equestrian order unparalleled across all of Europe."
 christian_berber_reform:0 "Berber Principality"
 christian_berber_reform_desc:0 "Albeit short, Roman rule over Mauretania has left a lasting mark: the Berber peoples have taken to Roman traditions and titles like fishes to water and, though noticeably marked by folk elements, the Berber realms retain the outline of Roman statesmanship to this very day."

 # Missions
 adu_beyond_cape_bojador_title:0 "Beyond Cape Bojador"
 adu_beyond_cape_bojador_desc:0 "Spies and retired crusaders generals - an unlikely duo if there ever was one - have sung to us the same song: berber merchants from beyond the Atlas emerge from the depths of the Sahara with caravan after caravan loaded with gold, ivory and all manner of intriguing trinkets and valuables. It is obvious to us that there are wealthy lands beyond the veil of the desert, but few dare brave its wrath; our explorers, however, present a different solution. We must sail close to the African coast, beyond the treacherous Cape Bojador, and trace this golden trail ever southwards!"
 adu_go_westward_title:0 "Go Westward"
 adu_go_westward_desc:0 "The winds and currents favor westward expansion! Our explorers believe that rich lands lie just over the horizon."
 adu_brazil_colonies_title:0 "Brazilian Dominance"
 adu_brazil_colonies_desc:0 "To appease the captains who discovered and partitioned the land, we must push forward and expand our territory in South America."
 adu_bandeirantes_title:0 "Promote the Bandeirantes"
 adu_bandeirantes_desc:0 "The Bandeirantes are private expeditionaries dedicated to exploring the Brazilian interior in search of natives to enslave. However, now there are whispers that there is gold to be found on the interior, which has caused many among the Bandeirantes to diversify their interests. We should sponsor their expeditions so that as many sources of gold are discovered as possible."
 adu_colombia_colonies_title:0 "Fields of Columbia"
 adu_colombia_colonies_desc:0 "The New World is a hostile and difficult realm. In the south, Brazil is covered in harsh, dense vegetation and plagued by unsuitable climates for conventional crops. In the north, the Aztecs guard their realms no less zealously than any king or count in Europe. In the center, however... there are no such impediments. The lands of Columbia, having been baptized as such due to witnessing Columbus' first landing on the Main, lie open for settling and farming - it would be a waste to throw away such a golden opportunity."
 adu_defeat_incas_title:0 "Dusk over the Incans"
 adu_defeat_incas_desc:0 "Pizarro has made a most interesting discovery as of late. It appears that the Aztecs are not the only high lords of these new lands; the Incas, shielded in their high mountain homes, reign over most of the Andes and, if their noble dresses are of any indication, a fair few veins of gold and silver..."
 adu_ceylon_title:0 "Ceylonese Succession"
 adu_ceylon_desc:0 "Our trading links with Ceylon have yielded a rather unexpected result; a local prince has died heirless and decreed that his realm should pass into Portuguese care following his death. Alas, it seems that others have steered the realm in other courses. We should disabuse them of the notion that they are allowed to do so."
 adu_competitive_advantage_title:0 "Assemble the Tercios"
 adu_competitive_advantage_desc:0 "Our military leaders have accumulated valuable battlefield experience over the past decades. As a result, we might be able to introduce a new recruitment and training system for our armies, which will result in a new military organization, the Tercio."
 adu_conquer_coastal_morocco_title:0 "Tame the Crusaders"
 adu_conquer_coastal_morocco_desc:0 "The Berbers have inhabited the lands of Mauretania since time immemorial and haunted our coasts and ships for just as long. In recent times, the region fell to Crusader rule, but that did little to quell the threat. Much the opposite, in fact. They see us as heathen dogs fit for nothing but death, and treat any ship flying our colors accordingly. It's about time we turn our gaze southwards and impose Andal rule on those lands, just as we once did to Iberia."
 adu_colonize_guinea_title:0 "Riches of Guinea"
 adu_colonize_guinea_desc:0 "The merchants were right! Just beyond the Bojador, the sickly desert fades into the green of Guinea, a land of rivers and grain not unlike our own southern reaches. The people here are queer: they follow some variation of the word of Christ, but their clothing, housing and tongue are completely alien. It matters not, for we understand one another well enough in a common tongue; that of Gold. The realms of Mali and Ghana are fabulously wealthy and seem willing, if appropriately persuaded, to let us partake in said wealth. We must capitalize on this opportunity and set up a factory nearby."
 adu_caribbean_title:0 "Colonize the Caribbean"
 adu_caribbean_desc:0 "Columbus was wrong! He returned from his expedition with devastating news: Japan is nowhere in sight, nor are the legendary riches of Cathay. Alas, the Indies are no further west from us than Arabia or the Steppes. However, not all is lost! Japan may elude us yet, but make no mistake - land was found. And by God will the Andals claim it."
 adu_defeat_aztecs_title:0 "Dusk over the Aztecs"
 adu_defeat_aztecs_desc:0 "Once mighty and incontestable, these Aztecs have fallen from grace. Their grip on power and authority wanes, and their subjects now openly speak of disregarding imperial commands. There can be no better opportunity: it is time for the men of Andalos to carve out new kingdoms in this New World, just as our ancestors did half a millenia ago!"
 adu_malabar_title:0 "Cities of the Malabar"
 adu_malabar_desc:0 "We must establish a series of factories along the Malabar coast to produce and market the spices that are native and abundant in the region. While we may be able to purchase some of the land, it may ultimately be necessary to seize it by force where we cannot reach an agreement with the Indian princes."
 adu_surat_title:0 "Seize Surat"
 adu_surat_desc:0 "Our merchants watch Surat hungrily as the fortunes of its rulers waver. We must pay close attention to the political climate of this region and seize an ideal moment to launch an assault on the city."
 adu_restore_order_title:0 "A Dish Served Cold"
 adu_restore_order_desc:0 "In our darkest hour, seven high lords chose to band together and plunge their accursed daggers into our backs. They failed: we perserve, as we always have. Five of them have been slain, and their holdings attained. Two remain: the duke of Cynetaía and the queen of Sarcaía. It's high time we remind them why it was not the crazed papists of the north nor the zealous muslims of the south who sealed the fate of Iberia, but us. And us alone."
 adu_flagship_title:0 "Hoist the Colours!"
 adu_flagship_desc:0 "Our realm is secure. The Pyrenees guard us from the petty feuds of the Franks and Germans, the Atlas shields us from the zealous Crusaders in Mauretania, and Trinacria's gaze does not linger in our possessions. It is clear that we now must turn to the seas and claim mastery of them lest another take such laurels."
 adu_congo_title:0 "Into the Congo"
 adu_congo_desc:0 "Only a few explorers have ventured south from the Ivory Coast, and fewer still have returned. Even so, the riches we have glimpsed from that accursed jungle are more than worth the blood we spill. It's high time we commit to this endeavour and assail the Congo in full!"
 adu_discover_east_africa_title:0 "Shipyards of the East"
 adu_discover_east_africa_desc:0 "No one knew what we would find on this journey of exploration, but one thing is clear: it is not over yet. We must lay claim to sheltered natural harbours, where our fleet can resupply."
 adu_african_gold_title:0 "African Gold"
 adu_african_gold_desc:0 "There is gold to be found in East Africa, and the mines are within reachable distance of our colonies on the coast. We must seize these mines for the glory of Andalos!"
 adu_bengal_title:0 "Land of a Thousand Rivers"
 adu_bengal_desc:0 "It is undeniable that the lands of the Tamil kings are the jewel of all India. Their craftsmen are renowned throughout the East, and for good reason. As luck would have it, however, such prestige has only given the Tamil monarchs more reason to guard their treasures and possessions greedily. Bengal, however, is a different story. The land is harsh, but the scattered cities present a level of wealth which, while clearly below those of Tamil heritage, is still far beyond most of what Europe itself can muster. Sooner or later, other explorers will sail by and make a note of this place - we ought to seize it to ourselves before they do."
 adu_burma_title:0 "Burmese Dominance"
 adu_burma_desc:0 "Several entrepots along the Burmese coast control a sizeable portion of trade that flows through the Bay of Bengal. To secure our trade dominance in the East, we must control these ports and thus control the commerce that passes through them."
 adu_indian_investment_title:0 "Casa da Índia"
 adu_indian_investment_desc:0 "It is time to establish an institution that will confirm and enforce our monopolies on all maritime trade leaving India. The Casa da Índia will be the greatest commercial force in all of Asia."
 adu_reform_navy_title:0 "The Westward Fleets"
 adu_reform_navy_desc:0 "Shipbuilding has progressed since the foundation of the Royal Arsenals in Sintra and Lisarra in the 13th century. Our previous vessels were incapable of braving the vast oceans and so, after much work and debate, we have crafted a new type of ship: the caravel!"
 adu_discover_cape_title:0 "The Cape of Good Hope"
 adu_discover_cape_desc:0 "Treacherous waters surround the legendary Cape of Torments, but who knows what wonders lie beyond? Our expansion puts great strain on the merchant fleet, and we must be sure to provide them adequate protection."
 adu_zanzibar_title:0 "Conquer Zanzibar"
 adu_zanzibar_desc:0 "The northern Swahili coast is covered in wealthy trading cities where Persian merchants come to buy gold and ivory in exchange for their own cloth and manufactured products. These trader cities are, however, quite precariously situated for someone controlling the open seas. Let us conquer these lands and put them firmly under Andal control!"
 adu_discover_horn_africa_title:0 "Of Spice and Mystics"
 adu_discover_horn_africa_desc:0 "At long last, our explorers have sailed around Africa in full and found there a most intriguing realm: a Christian one, the more faithful of the bunch were to happy to report, but an altogether queer one, where spice and silk flow in ludicrous amounts. It is obvious that we are nearing the source of these elusive goods - we must press ever further!"
 adu_discover_india_title:0 "Push to India"
 adu_discover_india_desc:0 "The Mystics of the East have grown lazy and indulgent in their splendor and wealth - they do not seek to push further east, to seek the Indies for themselves, as we do. After all, why strain yourself in such a manner if the bounty of the Indies flows to you by nature? We have no such luxury... but soon, neither will they. Let us push east and wrestle the spice trade from heathen hands!"
 adu_malacca_title:0 "Venice of the East"
 adu_malacca_desc:0 "Malacca is the single most important city in the East Indies. Its strategic position guarding the Straits and its long-established legacy as a merchant hub make it extremely desirable; we must ensure that it falls under Andal control!"
 adu_trade_with_china_title:0 "Trade with Cathay"
 adu_trade_with_china_desc:0 "China is a vast nation that is seemingly so abundant in resources that it needs no trade with the wider world. It would be difficult to convince Chinese rulers that our merchant ventures can be of value to them, but the potential rewards can hardly be understated."
 adu_trade_with_japan_title:0 "Trade with Japan"
 adu_trade_with_japan_desc:0 "Suspicious of all strangers, the feudal rulers of Japan are reluctant to allow any merchants the right to trade or even land in Japanese ports. We must find a way to overcome their suspicions and become the only European power with a foothold in this exclusive market."
 adu_swiss_alliance_title:0 "Swiss Alliance"
 adu_swiss_alliance_desc:0 "The alliance between Switzerland and Andalos has stood for generations, and must continue to do so for many generations to come."
 adu_fate_of_iberia_title:0 "Fate of Iberia"
 adu_fate_of_iberia_desc:0 "It is often said that we, of Andalos, have secured the fate of Iberia: that all who would call themselves a Lord must swear fealty to the Archon in Sintra, obey his laws and pay him due tribute. But some disagree, and look northwards: the ruler of Trinacria has long held mastery over Aragon and Catalonia, stripping us of the rights to call ourselves masters of these lands in full. It's high time we correct that."
 adu_imperial_andalos_title:0 "Ascendancy"
 adu_imperial_andalos_desc:0 "At long last, it is done. We now soar in heights previously thought unreachable: all of Iberia stands at our beck and call, our armies are the envy of Europe and our navies carry our laws and decress into new worlds. Spices, gold, ivory and silk flow into our harbours and peoples of all colors and creeds swear fealty to the Great Archon in Sintra. Truly, we outshine all others, perhaps even the Empires of Old - perhaps it is time that our 'peers' are made to agree..."
 adu_exploration_ideas_title:0 "Winds of Change"
 adu_exploration_ideas_desc:0 "Our explorations along the African coast are opening new routes and perspectives for the future of our country. It is up to us to take advantage of this opportunity for the expansion of Andalos overseas."
 adu_circumnavigation_title:0 "Charter the Seas"
 adu_circumnavigation_desc:0 "The explorations that we have promoted in the last decades have proven that the scientific theories about the rounded shape of the world were correct. Now we have the opportunity to become the first country to lead an expedition to circumnavigate the world, bringing great prestige to Andalos."
 adu_hormuz_title:0 "Conquer Hormuz"
 adu_hormuz_desc:0 "The straits of Hormuz are imperative to control the flow of trade between India, Iran and Mesopotamia. By seizing control over the island of Hormuz, we can dominate local trade and lay claim to the maritime empire it once created."
 adu_oman_title:0 "Lord of Oman"
 adu_oman_desc:0 "The jewel of the former Hormuzi trading empire, Muscat, is a well-protected city at the tip of the Arabian Peninsula. We must capture Muscat and fortify it against our rivals."
 adu_bahrain_title:0 "The Isle of Pearls"
 adu_bahrain_desc:0 "Our merchants have learned that most of the pearl flowing through our westbound trade routes originates in a small stretch of coast by the eastern edge of Arabia, namely the island of Bahrain. We ought to seize this isle and its illustrious pearls for the glory of Andalos!"
 adu_indonesia_title:0 "Jewels of the Empire"
 adu_indonesia_desc:0 "For centuries, the bounty of the far east Was barred to us - no more. We have gotten a taste for the thousand spices it grows and we want more. Unfortunately, we are not alone. All of Europe has set its gaze on the East Indies, and now even the most downtrodden Russian count dreams of carving a sliver of one such island for himself. We must act quick and seize these lands before others do!"
 adu_philippines_title:0 "Pearl of the Orient"
 adu_philippines_desc:0 "We have discovered large group of islands - Indian merchants call it 'Panyupayana' - that is rich in spices and precious gemstones. The native heathens are divided and unlikely to be able to resist an Andal invasion. We should launch an expedition with as many men as we can spare to conquer these valuable islands."
 adu_wine_monopolies_title:0 "Wine Monopolies"
 adu_wine_monopolies_desc:0 "The import and export of wine is tightly controlled in many atlantic ports. We should do everything in our power to secure trade agreements that grant us monopolies on the wine trade in as many parts as possible."
 adu_trading_houses_title:0 "Great Trading Houses"
 adu_trading_houses_desc:0 "Our decentralized methods of organizing our global trade must be reined in, formalized and fully accounted for. By establishing centralized Houses of Trade, we can ensure that commercial revenues from our merchant ventures are collected efficiently."
 adu_universities_title:0 "Arts and Letters"
 adu_universities_desc:0 "Andalos must be at the forefront of literary and academic culture in Europe, as our islamic predecessors once were. We must create and expand universities to bring about a new intellectual golden age in our nation."
 adu_develop_country_title:0 "The Two Citadels"
 adu_develop_country_desc:0 "For centuries, the course for Andalos - and, ultimately, all of Iberia - was set and steered by the happenings of three major courts: that of Sintra, the new capital, raised to splendor by the House of Sintra; that of Madragal, the old capital, as inherited from our islamic predecessors; and that of Leragal, an older capital still and a remnant from a bygone visigothic age. However, times have changed. Now, it is between two great citadels that our future is chartered: that of Sintra, and that of Lisarra. If we are to establish a true empire and be remembered as such, it is imperative that these great cities look the part. We must seek to have the most illustrious cities, such that even the likes of Venice, Palermo and Geneva will seem like dirty hamlets in comparison."
 adu_revoke_privileges_title:0 "Revoke the Old Privileges"
 adu_revoke_privileges_desc:0 "Ever since days of Aelias the Blacksword have the realms beyond the Arganic mountains been granted a distinctly higher degree of autonomy face the rest of the realm. In his times, this was a clever arrangement: the northern crowns, although defeated, still donned sharp steel in their scabbards, and the realm could ill afford constant warring in such faraway territories; we gained tribute and fealty, they kept their arms and titles.\n\nFour centuries have passed since then, and the political climate of Iberia is no longer the same. The glory of the northern crowns has faded, and talk of disloyalty is heard only among the senile or the thoughtless youth. Despite this, their old privileges still allow for various political factions and estates to harbour significant influence and sway, practically unparalleled in the Andal south. We must rid ourselves of these elements and centralize the lands of Hispania under the Andal Crown for once and for all."

 # Ideas
 adu_idea_1:0 "Beyond the Cape"
 adu_idea_1_desc:0 "Merchants and spies both weave tales of yet-unseen realms beyond the treacherous capes of Morocco teeming with wealth and power ripe for the taking. With our borders firmly set and our rivals deterred or otherwise distracted, there can be no better time to validate such claims. Let us call upon our captains and explorers and set sail southwards!"
 adu_idea_2:0 "Halls of Endless Debate"
 adu_idea_2_desc:0 "Owing both to our hellenic and islamic heritages, a great deal of importance is placed upon the scholarly arts within the Andal realm. Our two citadels, the Golden in Sintra and the Silver in Lisarra, serve twofold as high courts for our nobility and serene temples to intelligence, science and research, being famed across the continent as the birthplace of many breakthroughs."
 adu_idea_3:0 "A Ship in Every Sea"
 adu_idea_3_desc:0 "Nobles and merchants both joke that there is not a gulf or sea in this world on which an Andal ship isn't sailing at any given moment. This is a clear exaggeration, but it is quite telling as to the cess of our maritime ventures: previously a wartorn backwater, the lands of the Andal crown now see ludicrous amounts of goods and wealth drifting into its harbours, and the health of its treasury clearly reflects that."
 adu_idea_4:0 "New Kingdoms"
 adu_idea_4_desc:0 "Just as our ancestors did nearly five hundred years ago, it is imperative that we plant our arms in these virgin lands and build new kingdoms atop them! Let the foolish kings of Europe feud amongst themselves, let them waste themselves in their petty delusions of grandeur whilst we secure for ourselves a legacy greater than even Rome itself!"
 adu_idea_5:0 "Homesteading"
 adu_idea_5_desc:0 "For centuries, our feudal nobility has been a heavy burden for the Crown to bear. Scores of worthless nobles clung to privileges, influence and power earned in times long gone and deprived the realm of a much-needed ability to react, to adapt and to reimagine itself in face of the challenges it now faces. At long last, they are gone, and the Crown has taken such developments in stride: now, any man - highborn or otherwise - who accomplishes a great deed for the realm is to be awarded a parcel of land to live in, to develop, to care for and manage, all in the Archon's name."
 adu_idea_6:0 "Blacksteel Foundries"
 adu_idea_6_desc:0 "Andalos is a realm famed for many qualities: its prolific merchants, its loyal officers, its natural beauty, its rich traditions and so on. Its spies and intelligence are not among that list, but undeservedly so. Generation after generation, families of spies have carted back absolute bibles worth of information on foreign concerns, namely their craftsmanship. Owing to this, our foundries and smithies are unparalleled, producing higher quality weaponry and artillery than any other power within sight."
 adu_idea_7:0 "One under the Archon"
 adu_idea_7_desc:0 "Every man who wishes to enter into the Archon's service, be it in His armies, in His navies, in His companies or His offices and bureaus must swear a solemn oath: to know no lord but the Archon in Sintra, to obey no command but that from the Archon in Sintra and to pay no tribute but to the Archon in Sintra. The Archon is absolute, and all are His subjects."
