 andal_crown_reform_desc:0 "Nearly four centuries ago, Auria Cintranos, known thereafter as 'the Dreamer', foresaw a most terrible fate for her people and her house, then only Dukes of Hellas. Few believed her in the Azure Court, yet it took very little time for the young oracle to be proven right. So we acted. We fled first to Sardinia, then to islamic 'Isbiliya' and founded here a realm mightier than Auria could've ever foreseen."

 andal_subject_reform_desc:0 "The fate of Hispania has been resolved. The Andals, a people born of an unlikely marriage between the Hellenes of the East and the Mozarabs of the South, have donned an iron wreath and claimed all of Hispania as their rightful domain. We are lords and dukes in our own right, aye, but it is Andal law, Andal tradition and Andal decrees that permeate and govern our realm, for good and for bad."
