The cult of law and justice prevailed in his time. Each in the kingdom was satisfied with his fate.

The peace of Caltabellotta, in 1302, sanctioned the end of the war and gave the aforementioned separation (according to the agreements, on the death of the Aragonese king Frederick of Aragon, the island should have returned to the Angevins, which in reality did not happen). \nAnd still we are awaiting, for the time now is right to rivendicate our claims on the crown of Aragon and crushing it completely."

 sic_isle_of_malta_title: "Màuta"
 sic_isle_of_malta_desc: "The island fell in 870 under the rule of the Arabs, who eliminated almost all the original inhabitants and repopulated the archipelago, building the new capital Mdina on the site of the previous Roman city of Melita. The new rulers introduced the cultivation of cedar and cotton, built an irrigation system and, in particular, the Arabic language, which most of the population adopted as their mother tongue. Its influence in modern Maltese is easily found, as well as the presence of words of Latin origin and of the Latin alphabet. The Arab domination lasted for about two centuries, from 870 to 1091, during which Islam became the main religion on the island (although Christians were allowed to practice their worship). \nThe period of Arab domination ended in 1091 when the island was conquered by the Normans from the Kingdom of Sicily, at the helm of Ruggero d'Altavilla. The archipelago thus entered the Sicilian orbit, and was placed under the control of the members of the Norman house of Sicily, although in fact it was a little more than nominal control. In 1191 Margarito of Brindisi landed again on the island and was appointed first count of Malta. The ties of the island with Sicily consequently became ever closer, and the fiefdom was subsequently granted to the families of the highest Sicilian nobility."

To generate the episode was the reaction to the gesture of a soldier of the Aragonese army, such Drouet, who had turned disrespectfully to a young noblewoman accompanied by his wife, putting his hands on her on the pretext of having to search her. In defense of his wife, the groom managed to steal the sword from the soldier and kill him. This gesture constituted the spark that started the revolt. In the course of the evening and the night that followed the people of Palermo - with the cry of "Mora, mora!" - they indulged in a real "hunt for the Aragonese" which quickly spread throughout the island, becoming a carnage. The few Aragonese who survived the massacre succeeded in taking refuge in their ships, moored along the coast."

The "Regolamento (…) para el extablaciemiento (…) de su Exquadra de Galeras, Arsenal, Darsena…" were promulgated. \nA team of four galleys was therefore formed which formed the first nucleus of a Navy which would develop in the following years until it reached a fully respectable dimension towards the end of the century, fully responding to the needs of the Kingdom, namely the protection of maritime trade, vital to the kingdom, by Barbary pirates."

The greatest artists of the period are Gaspare da Pesaro and his son Guglielmo Pesaro. \nIn architecture, the intense construction activity is characterized by its adherence to late Gothic forms with the Iberian mark (especially in the Val di Noto), and by the persistence of decorations and planimetric motifs that have been repeated since the Norman era. \nPalermo and Messina, among the main cities, went through a phase of demographic and economic growth in the fifteenth century thanks to the presence of the port and numerous communities of Pisan, Venetian, Lombard and Genoese merchants. Even the social structure of the city was renewed with a class of officials and merchants who joined the nobility by building noble palaces and chapels and requesting refined artifacts of great value. \nThese premises, thanks to the arrival of numerous artists of the peninsula and the influence of the Neapolitan artistic environment of the Alfonso II period, allowed the renewal of the artistic language in Sicily."
